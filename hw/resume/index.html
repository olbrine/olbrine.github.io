    <h4>University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL <br> Class of 2022 <br> Bachelors of Science in Communications for Motion Pictures and
      Interactive Media<br> Minors in Africana Studies and Sociology </h4>
    <p>Hello! My name is Olbrine Thelusma and I was born in Naples, Florida and raised in Orlando, Florida. My parents are Haitian immigrants to the United States. I have recently been trying to get better at speaking Haitian Creole by placing myself
      in the Haitian community in South Florida and through the relationships I have gained while at the university. Currently, I am a sophomore majoring in Motion Pictures on the Production track and Interactive Media with minors in Africana Studies
      and Sociology. I grew a passion for film when I started seeing creators depict the black experience in different genres and I wanted to be able to tell my own stories that would put people of color in the forefront of those stories. I decided
      to take on Africana Studies and Sociology because of my interests in African history, societal behaviors, and human nature. I want to implement the things I learn in my minors in my future projects in the film industry and in my work through
      creative directing for smaller projects like promotional content.
