      <p class="intro">The Nike Air Force 1, which debuted in 1982 and has since served as a canvas for artists and designers of all ilk, indisputably achieves the latter classification. During the decades, the AF1's iconic design has undergone
        subtle updates to
        reflect the current moment, without sacrificing its distinct DNA. In its mutability — because of it — the shoe has become a global street culture standard. Nike designer Bruce Kilgore’s creation, initially only available as a high top, was
        striking for its hiking-boot-inspired cues and uniquely chunky sole—it was the first Nike Air cushioning on a hoops shoe. The neutral white and grey palette was one of the only parts of the shoe that played it safe. Inevitably, bolder,
        team-color Forces would follow—as would a low-cut, making the Air Force 1 an even more popular choice when it hit retail on a wider scale in 1983.</p>
